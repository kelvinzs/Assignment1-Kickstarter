# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project was to conduct an analysis of varying fundraising campaingns based on a set of predetermined criteria, in relation to their launch dates and funding goals using the dataset provided.   
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to assist the client louise determine how different campaigns perfomed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
To facailiate the analysis a new colum/field titled 'year' and the Parent and subcategory column was split into two new columns titled 'Parent category' and 'subcategory'.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot table was utilized in the analysis of outcomes based on launch dates. The pivot table was filtered using the 'parent category' and 'years'. A line graph was used to visualize the relationship between theater outcomes based on lunch dates. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Inorder to facilitate the analysis of outcomes based on goals, a sheet containing 8 new column fields and 12 rows was created. Goal amounts were binned into 12 distinct levels. A line Chart was utilized to visualize the data to aid inference.     
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The major challenege i experienced was there were some concepts that were not clear in the notes but i got clarification from the internet and the supplementary resources provided on slack.  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Inferences that could be drawn from the result include; 
1)May recorded the highest number of successful outcomes based on launch date and as such should be reccomeneded for any client starting a fundraising campaingn. 
2)January recorded a significantly higher number of cancelled campaigns, more research required.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The results gotten from the analysis suggests that fundraising campaign outcomes(success and failure) based on goals are normally distributed within the sample. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The Dataset is a sample and not an accurate representation of the population and as such it susciptible to various kinds of errors/bias. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A bar graph could also have been utilized to visualize the various percent outcomes or percent goals agianst the varying binned levels.
